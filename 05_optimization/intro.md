# Approaches

## Divide and Conquer (D&C)

A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking the problem down into two or more subproblems of the same or related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly [1]. Then one combines the results of subproblems to form the final solution.

## Back Tracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems (notably Constraint satisfaction problems or CSPs), which incrementally builds candidates to the solution and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.
