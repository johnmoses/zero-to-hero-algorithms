# Approaches

## Back Tracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems (notably Constraint satisfaction problems or CSPs), which incrementally builds candidates to the solution and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.
It is a way of speeding up the search process by removing the most unlikely candidates

## Knapsack

This is another combinatorial optimization approach. For example, given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
