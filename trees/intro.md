# Trees

A tree T can be defined formally as a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent-child relationship that satisfies the following properties

- If T is nonempty, it has a special node, called the root of T , that has no parent.
- Each node v of T different from the root has a unique parent node w; every node with parent w is a child of w.

A tree is and abstract data type (ADT) that stores elements hierarchically. It is the most important non-linear data structure in computing. It has made better file systems, graphic user interfaces, database, web sites and lots more.

The relationship between objects are hierarichal in terms of parent-child, ancestor-decendants arrangements. It is typically like a tree that has a root, branches, and branches that have branches on and on.

Programatically we could define a tree T as a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent-child relationship

A typical implementation of a tree is binary trees that use linked structures

## Tree Terminology

- Node: An item stored in the tree
- Root: The topmost node that has no parent
- Child: A node immediately below and directly connected to a given node
- Parent: A node immediately above and directly connected to a given node
- Siblings: The children of a common parent
- Leaf: A node that has no children
- Interior node: A node that has at least one child
- Edge/Branch/Link: The line that connects a parent to the child
- Descendant: All the node's children down to the leaves
- Ancestor: A node's parent up to the root
- Path: The sequence of edges that connects a noe with one of its descendants
- Path Length: The number of edges in a path
- Depth or Level: The length of the path connecting the root
- Height: The length of the longest path
- Subtree: A tree formed from viewpoint of a node and all its descendants
