# Queues

A queue is collection of objects that are inserted or removed according to first-in, first-out(FIFO) principle. It is a fundamental data structure. A functional or real world example is people waiting at a train station to get tickets for their trips. It can be called first-come, first-serve.
We see queues in real life at gas stations, counters, reservation centers, stores, theatres.

Queue abstract data type (ADT) supports enqueue and dequeue operations. Enqueue adds element to the back of the queue while dequeue removes the first element at the front and returns first element.

Other methods are `first(), is_empty(), len(Q)`.

## Priority queues

This is a special type of queues that has a slight departure from the reqular queue policy. Here some very important exceptions are acommodated for insertion or removal of elements from the queues.

## Heaps

A heap is an improvement over priority queue that achieves a faster and more efficient data structure.
