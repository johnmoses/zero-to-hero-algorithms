# Trees

A tree T can be defined formally as a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent-child relationship that satisfies the following properties
-  If T is nonempty, it has a special node, called the root of T , that has no parent.
- Each node v of T different from the root has a unique parent node w; every node with parent w is a child of w.

A tree is and abstract data type (ADT) that stores elements hierarchically. It is the most important non-linear data structure in computing. It has made better file systems, graphic user interfaces, database, web sites and lots more.

The relationship between objects are hierarichal in terms of parent-child, ancestor-decendants arrangements. It is typically like a tree that has a root, branches, and branches that have branches on and on.

Programatically we could define a tree T as a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent-child relationship

A typical implementation of a tree is binary trees that use linked structures
