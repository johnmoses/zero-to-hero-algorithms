# Basic Algorithms

We will start with basic or simple algorithms. Recursion is one of the simplest methods of solving problems.

## Divide and Conquer (D&C)

A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking the problem down into two or more subproblems of the same or related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly [1]. Then one combines the results of subproblems to form the final solution.
